About

This software is meant to create HTML forms with hidden inputs.
The parameters are transformed to hidden inputs in the form.
This software is still in development, and is meant as a tool for creating multiple HTML forms from lists of parameters with the same structure.

How to

Put the right values in the Action and Method fields.
Put a regular expression matching your parameters structure and catching them in pairs name/value.
	Ex: to catch the name and value of "PARAMETER :: control=12 "
		put a regexp like "PARAMETER :: (.+?)=(.*) "
		the first catching expression will be inserted as the name of the input, and the second as its value.
Put you parameters list in the text zone.
Click "Create form".
Enjoy
